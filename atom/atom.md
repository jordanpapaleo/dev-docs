# Atom Packages

There are a ton of packages that can be installed for atom.  The first list are ones that are really needed for dev.  The second list are not required but make life easier.

If you installed the Atom shell commands, you can install these with the `apm install` coommand the same way you would with a node module.  By doing this you will also need to update them from the terminal as well using `apm update`.

The alternative is to just manually install them via Atom's preference menu.
